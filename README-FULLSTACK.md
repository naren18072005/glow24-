## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
- Frontend (.env in root directory):
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
  ```
- Backend (server/.env):
  ```
  PORT=5000
  ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

#### Option 1: Run Frontend and Backend Separately
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Option 2: Run Both Concurrently
Use the provided script to run both frontend and backend concurrently:
```bash
node run-dev.js
```

### Production Deployment

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Set up a production server to:
   - Serve the Express backend
   - Serve the static files from the `dist` directory

## API Endpoints

### Products
- `GET /api/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get product by ID

### Orders
- `POST /api/orders` - Create a new order
- `GET /api/orders/:orderId/track` - Get tracking information for an order
- `PUT /api/orders/:orderId/status` - Update order status

## Notes for Development

- The backend runs on port 5000 by default
- The frontend development server runs on port 8080 by default
- API requests from the frontend are proxied to the backend server
- In development mode, the backend serves mock data
- For production, you'll want to connect to a real database
